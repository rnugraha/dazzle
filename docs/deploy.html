<h1>Deploying the Dazzle servlet</h1>

<p>
This document describes the steps required to install and start
the Dazzle server.  Some knowledge of the DAS system is assumed:
read the <a href="http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html">specification</a>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
These instructions apply to release 1.00 of Dazzle.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
Dazzle requires a runtime environment for the Java 2 platform,
standard edition (J2SE) version 1.4 or later.
It also requires a servlet container complying with the servlets
2.3 specification (a servlet container is a Java-aware web
server).  Dazzle was developed using the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Tomcat 4.0</a> servlet container,
and this is recommended.  It has also been tested successfully using
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a>.
</p>

<h2>The webapp structure</h2>

<p>
Servlet containers work with bundles of code and data known
as <em>webapps</em>.  To deploy Dazzle, you must create a webapp
with a well-defined structure.  The required files and directories
are shown below:
</p>

<pre>
WEB-INF/
    web.xml                       Deployment descriptor, used by the servlet container.
    lib/
        biojava.jar               BioJava library
        bytecode.jar              (Required for BioJava)
        dazzle.jar                DazzleServer code
    classes/
dazzlecfg.xml                     Data-sources configuration file
stylesheet.xml                    Default DAS stylesheet
welcome.html                      Welcome message, included front page
</pre>

<p>
You can add your own data files to this structure, either at the
top level or in your own directories.  If you are using a datasource
plugin which isn't included in the core Dazzle package, you can
either package it as a JAR file (if it isn't already) and place it
in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory, or place raw .class files
in the <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
You can download a complete `skeleton' webapp with all these files in
place from the Dazzle homepage.  In this case, you just need to unpack
the skeleton, configure your datasources, then follow the deployment
instructions below.  Alternatively, you can download the source and
compile your own.  If so, you will need the following:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>BioJava (current version)</dt>
<dd>Available from <a href="http://www.biojava.org/">BioJava.org</a>.  Until
the BioJava 1.4 release is ready, it is recommended that you use a
<a href="http://www.derkholm.net/autobuild/">nightly build</a>.
</dd>

<dt>BioJava bytecode library</dt>
<dd>Binaries can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.biojava.org/">BioJava.org</a>.
Also in BioJava CVS.</dd>

<dt>servlet.jar</dt>
<dd>The Java Servlet 2.3 API files.  This should be included with your Servlet
container distribution.  These are only needed for compiling Dazzle: when you
deploy the servlet, it should automatically pick up servlet API classes from
the servlet container.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The current Dazzle sourcecode is available from the
<a href="http://www.derkholm.net/svn/repos/dazzle/">BioJava Subversion repository</a>. 
Follow the
instructions there to connect to the server and check out the <code>dazzle</code>
module.  You will need to copy all the libraries above into the dazzle directory,
then use the supplied ANT build-script to compile the code.
</p>

<h2>Configuring datasources</h2>

<p>
Dazzle relies on small datasource plugins to supply sequence and feature
data, and also to customize the DAS messages.  Each Dazzle installation includes
one or more data sources.  These are defined in an XML configuration file,
dazzlecfg.xml.  A typical example is shown below:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;

&lt;!-- Sample Dazzle configuration file --&gt;

&lt;dazzle xmlns="http://www.biojava.org/2000/dazzle"&gt;
  &lt;datasource id="test" jclass="org.biojava.servlets.dazzle.datasource.EmblDataSource"&gt;
    &lt;string name="name" value="Test seqs" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="description" value="Evalutation sequences for promoter-finding software" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="version" value="1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="fileName" value="test.embl" /&gt;

    &lt;string name="stylesheet" value="test.style" /&gt;
  &lt;/datasource&gt;

  &lt;datasource id="tss" jclass="org.biojava.servlets.dazzle.datasource.GFFAnnotationSource"&gt;
    &lt;string name="name" value="TSS" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="description" value="Transcription start sites for fickett set" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="version" value="1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="fileName" value="fickett-tss.gff" /&gt;
    &lt;boolean name="dotVersions" value="true" /&gt;
    &lt;string name="mapMaster" value="http://my-server:8080/das/test/" /&gt;

    &lt;string name="stylesheet" value="tss.style" /&gt;
  &lt;/datasource&gt;
&lt;/dazzle&gt;

</pre>

<p>
Each <code>datasource</code> element has two required attributes: a unique
ID, and the fully-qualified Java class-name of the plugin.  The <code>datasource</code>
element can contain any number of property elements, which set some property of
the plugin.  Property elements are always named after the data-type of the property
to be set, and have two attributes: name and value.  The set of properties recognized
by a given plugin should be listed in the plugin documentation. (NOTE: The format
of the property elements may change in a future release to match the SOAP encoding
rules).
</p>

<p>
Some properties are commonly recognized by many plugins:
</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>version - the version of the database being served</li>
<li>stylesheet - a path to a DAS stylesheet, relative to the top level of the webapp</li>
<li>mapMaster</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>mapMaster</code> attribute is recognized by all annotation
server plugins.  It should be set to a URL pointing to the reference server
whose sequences are annotated by this data source.  Note that this must
always be an absolute URL, even if the reference datasource is contained
within the same Dazzle webapp.
</p>

<h2>The EMBL-file plugin</h2>

<p>
The EMBL-file plugin provides a DAS reference datasource
backed by a standard EMBL-format flatfile.  It is included
in the basic Dazzle package, with classname
<code>org.biojava.servlets.dazzle.datasource.EmblDataSource</code>.
</p>

<p>
Properties of the EMBL plugin:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Datatype</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>name</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The display name of the datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>A textual description of the datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>version</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The version of the database being served (note that individual sequences are served with version numbers taken from the EMBL file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>stylesheet</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Filename of a DAS stylesheet to associate with this datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>fileName</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Name of an EMBL file which is read at startup.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>The GFF plugin</h2>

<p>
The GFF plugin is a very lightweight annotation datasource, backed
by a GFF version 2 file.  It is very easy to set up, but has some
limitations (no complex features, no links out to external data).
A more sophisticated `general purpose' annotation datasource should
be released soon.
</p>

<p>
The GFF plugin has class name
<code>org.biojava.servlets.dazzle.datasource.GFFAnnotationSource</code>.
The following properties are available:
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Datatype</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>name</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The display name of the datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>A textual description of the datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>version</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>The version of the database being served.  Individual sequences are served with version numbers copies from the reference server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>stylesheet</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Filename of a DAS stylesheet to associate with this datasource</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>mapMaster</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>URL of a DAS reference server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>fileName</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Name of a GFF file which is read at startup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>dotVersions</td>
  <td>boolean</td>
  <td>Interpret sequence names contains a '.' character as <em>id</em>.<em>version</em>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Packaging and deployment</h2>

<p>
Once you are happy with your configuration file, and you've added any extra
resource files that are needed, you should package the webapp as a WAR file.
WAR files are just normal Java ARchives (JAR files) which contain a WEB-INF
directory and a web.xml file (as show in the directory tree, above).  To
create this file, change into the directory where you have been building your
webapp, and type:
</p>

<blockquote>
jar cf ../das.war *
</blockquote>

<p>
By convention, webapps containing DAS servers are called das.war, but this
isn't strictly necessary.
</p>

<p>
Details of deploying webapps vary between containers.  If you are using
Tomcat, simply copy the <code>das.war</code> file into the ${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps/
directory, then re-start the server.  Note that Tomcat creates temporary directories
for each deployed webapp (e.g. a <code>das/</code> directory corresponding to das.war).
If you are replacing an existing webapp with a newer version, you should shut down
the server then delete the temporary directory before deploying the new webapp.
</p>

<p>
When the webapp is deployed, you can test it with your favourite DAS browser.
You can also try visiting the root page (for instance, http://my-server:8080/das/) using
a web browser -- you should see a welcome page listing the available data sources.  Note
that the welcome page can be customized by editing the <code>welcome.html</code>
file in your webapp.
