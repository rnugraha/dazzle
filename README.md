======

Dazzle is an easy to use server for the Distributed Annotation System (DAS).
It is implemented as a Java servlet, using the BioJava APIs. Dazzle is a modular system which uses small "datasource plugins" to provide access to a range of databases. Several general-purpose plugins are included in the package, and it it straightforward to develop new plugins to connect to your own databases.
Dazzle has been developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute by Thomas Down.
